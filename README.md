Data Loading and Preprocessing
Data Loading: The code begins by loading a dataset named "laptop_price.csv" using Pandas' read_csv function.
Data Preprocessing: It performs various data preprocessing steps such as dropping unnecessary columns (laptop_ID), handling missing values (dropna), removing duplicates (drop_duplicates), and creating a new Price column by converting the original price column (Price_euros) to another currency by multiplying by a conversion factor.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis: The code visualizes the distribution of categorical features like Company, TypeName, Inches, ScreenResolution, Ram, Cpu, Memory, Gpu, OpSys, Weight, Touchscreen, IPS, and ppi. It uses bar plots and histograms to analyze the relationship between these features and the target variable (Price).
Model Building and Evaluation
Model Selection: Several machine learning algorithms are trained and evaluated for regression tasks using the Pipeline and ColumnTransformer from Scikit-learn. Algorithms include Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, KNeighborsRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, SVR, AdaBoostRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor, and GradientBoostingRegressor.
Evaluation Metrics: After training each model, it computes and prints the R-squared score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the model's performance.
Deployment (Streamlit and Local Tunnel)
Streamlit Setup: It appears to have commented out code meant for deploying the model using Streamlit. The Streamlit app is designed to take user input for laptop specifications and use the trained model to predict the price.
Local Tunneling: There are commands at the end to run the Streamlit app and set up a local tunnel for web access to the app using ngrok or a similar service.
